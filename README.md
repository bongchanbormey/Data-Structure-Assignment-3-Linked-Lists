## Data-Structure-Assignment-3-Linked-Lists
### Project Requirements:
1. The LinkedList class must make use of the Link class and must have the following constructors and methods:
   - (a) public LinkedList()
   - (b) public void insertFirst(T newItem)
   - (c) public void insertLast(T newItem)
   - (d) public void insertAt(T newItem)
   - (e) public boolean deleteFirst()
   - (f) public boolean deleteLast()
   - (g) public boolean deleteAt(int index)
   - (h) public boolean deleteKey(T key)
   - (i) public int find(T key)
   - (j) public boolean isEmpty()
   - (k) public String toString()
   - (l) public void display()
2. The Link class must have the following attributes:
   - (a) T data
   - (b) Link next
3. The DoublyLinkedList class must make use of the DoublyLink class and must have the following constructors and methods:
   - (a) public LinkedList()
   - (b) public void insertFirst(T newItem)
   - (c) public void insertLast(T newItem)
   - (d) public void insertAt(T newItem)
   - (e) public boolean deleteFirst()
   - (f) public boolean deleteLast()
   - (g) public boolean deleteAt(int index)
   - (h) public boolean deleteKey(T key)
   - (i) public int find(T key)
   - (j) public boolean isEmpty()
   - (k) public String toString()
   - (l) public void displayForward()
   - (m) public void displayBackward()
4. The DoublyLink class must have the following attributes:
   - (a) T data
   - (b) Link next
   - (c) Link previous
5. The LinkedList class and the DoublyLinkedList class must be double-ended. Meaning they must
have head and tail pointers.
6. The LinkedList class and the DoublyLinkedList class must be generic classes.
7. TheremustbetheLinkclassfortheLinkedListclassandtheDoublyLinkclassfortheDoublyLinkedList class. Both the Link class and the DoublyLink class must be generic classes.
8. Change the implementation of your Stack class from assignment 2 to make use of the LinkedList class above. All other requirements from assignment 2 still applies to your Stack class.
9. Change the implementation of your Queue class from assignment 2 to make use of the LinkedList class above. All other requirements from assignment 2 still applies to your Queue class.
10. There must be a comment on all your methods to document its time complexity.
